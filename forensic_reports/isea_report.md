## Executive Summary

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Image | `synthetic_test.img` |
| Size | 10.0 MB |
| Total Clusters | 2,560 |
| Wipe Regions Detected | 3 |
| Evidence Score | **58.8/100** |

### Analyst Hypothesis

> The wipe activity appears to be a non-targeted, full-disk wipe with moderate intensity, lacking temporal correlation with file deletions and no evidence of targeting sensitive directories.

## Wipe Region Detections

**3 wipe region(s) identified.**

| # | Clusters | Tool | Algorithm | Passes | Confidence | Entropy |
|---|----------|------|-----------|--------|------------|---------|
| 1 | 0–499 (500) | DBAN | DoD_Short | 3 | 60% | 7.03 |
| 2 | 700–2099 (1400) | dd if=/dev/urandom | Random_Fill | 3 | 59% | 7.23 |
| 3 | 2150–2559 (410) | DBAN | DoD_Short | 3 | 60% | 7.03 |

## Behavioral Intent Assessment

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Intent Score | **42.0/100** |
| Confidence Tier | **MEDIUM** |
| Wipe Scope | full_disk |
| Temporal Correlation | False |
| Sensitive Dir Targeted | False |

**Behavioral Evidence Points:**
- AI Agentic Analysis applied to crime scene
- Full-disk or partition-level wipe — possible scorched-earth approach
- Moderate wipe intensity (59%) — partial or interrupted wipe

---

## Evidence Scoring

**Overall Evidence Score: 58.8/100**  
**Evidence Strength Rating: PROBABLE**

| Component | Weight | Contribution |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Behavioral Intent Score | 40% | 16.8/40 |
| Wipe Fraction | 30% | 27.1/30 |
| Signature Match Confidence | 20% | — |
| Region Count Factor | 10% | 3.0/10 |

## Recommended Actions

- Preserve the disk image with hash verification
- Cross-reference wipe timestamps with user session data
- Examine network logs for data exfiltration prior to wipe
- Consult a forensics professional for deeper analysis
- Full-disk wipe detected — consider live memory forensics if system is still running
